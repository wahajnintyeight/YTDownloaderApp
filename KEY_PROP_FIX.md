# Key Prop Warning Fix

## Issue

```
Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
Check the render method of `ScrollView`. It was passed a child from VirtualizedList.
```

## Root Cause

The warning was coming from the FlatList in BrowseScreen. Even though we had a `keyExtractor`, there were potential issues:

1. The `getItemLayout` prop can sometimes cause VirtualizedList to complain about keys
2. If video IDs are not unique, the keyExtractor would generate duplicate keys

## Solution Applied

### Changes in BrowseScreen.tsx:

1. **Enhanced keyExtractor for guaranteed uniqueness:**

```typescript
// Before:
keyExtractor={item => item.id}

// After:
keyExtractor={(item, index) => `${item.id}-${index}`}
```

This ensures each item has a unique key even if video IDs somehow duplicate.

2. **Removed getItemLayout:**

```typescript
// Removed this prop which can cause VirtualizedList warnings:
getItemLayout={(data, index) => ({
  length: 100,
  offset: 100 * index,
  index,
})}
```

While this was a performance optimization, it can cause issues with dynamic content heights and key warnings.

3. **Simplified ListFooterComponent:**

```typescript
// Removed explicit key prop from footer
ListFooterComponent={
  hasMore && loading ? (
    <View style={{ paddingVertical: 20 }}>
      <LoadingAnimation type="general" visible={true} size="small" />
    </View>
  ) : null
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **Unique Keys**: By combining the video ID with the index, we guarantee uniqueness
2. **No Layout Conflicts**: Removing `getItemLayout` lets React Native handle the layout naturally
3. **Cleaner Footer**: The footer component doesn't need an explicit key since it's not part of the data array

## Trade-offs

- **Performance**: Removing `getItemLayout` means slightly less optimized scrolling for very long lists
- **Benefit**: No more warnings and more stable rendering

For most use cases (even lists with hundreds of items), the performance difference is negligible on modern devices.

## Testing

- [ ] Browse for videos and verify no key prop warnings
- [ ] Scroll through search results smoothly
- [ ] Load more results at the end of the list
- [ ] Refresh the list with pull-to-refresh
