# Download Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented the download functionality for the YouTube Downloader app with server-side event streaming support.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Download Service (`src/services/downloadService.ts`)
- **Removed client-side UUID generation** - Server now generates download IDs
- **Updated SSE URL** to use `sse.theprojectphoenix.top`
- **React Native compatibility** - Replaced EventSource with polling mechanism
- **File saving** - Uses react-native-fs to save files to device storage
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error handling with timeouts and retry logic

### 2. API Client Updates (`src/services/apiClient.ts`)
- Updated download method signature to work with file paths instead of blobs
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing interface

### 3. Download Hook Updates (`src/hooks/useDownloads.tsx`)
- Updated to handle async download initiation
- Changed completion handler to work with file paths

### 4. UI Components
- **DownloadModal** - Enhanced with better loading states and user feedback
- **DownloadProgress** - New component for showing download progress (ready for future use)

### 5. Testing Utilities
- Created `testDownload.ts` utility for testing download functionality

## Flow Implementation

The download flow now works as follows:

1. **Client Request**: POST to `/v2/api/download-yt-videos` with:
   ```json
   {
     "videoId": "GT8ornYrDEs",
     "format": "mp3",
     "bitRate": "320k"
   }
   ```

2. **Server Response**: Returns download ID:
   ```json
   {
     "downloadId": "server-generated-uuid"
   }
   ```

3. **Status Polling**: Client polls `https://sse.theprojectphoenix.top/status/{downloadId}` every 2 seconds

4. **Progress Updates**: Server responds with:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "download_progress",
     "progress": 45,
     "downloadId": "..."
   }
   ```

5. **Completion**: Server responds with:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "download_complete",
     "fileData": "base64-encoded-file",
     "filename": "video-title.mp3",
     "mimeType": "audio/mpeg",
     "downloadId": "..."
   }
   ```

6. **File Saving**: Client decodes base64 and saves to device storage

## Features Implemented

- ✅ Server-generated download IDs
- ✅ Correct SSE endpoint usage
- ✅ React Native compatibility (polling instead of EventSource)
- ✅ File saving to device storage
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Error handling with timeouts
- ✅ Concurrent download support
- ✅ User-friendly loading states

## Next Steps

1. Test with real server endpoints
2. Add download queue management
3. Implement background download notifications
4. Add download history/management screen
5. Optimize polling frequency based on download progress

## Dependencies Added

- `uuid` and `@types/uuid` for any future UUID needs
- Uses existing `react-native-fs` for file operations
