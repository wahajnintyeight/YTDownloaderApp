# Additional Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: Missing Key Prop Warning
**Error:** `Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop`

**Location:** BrowseScreen.tsx - FlatList's ListFooterComponent

**Fix:** Added explicit `key="footer-loading"` prop to the footer View component:
```typescript
ListFooterComponent={
  hasMore && loading ? (
    <View key="footer-loading" style={{ paddingVertical: 20 }}>
      <LoadingAnimation type="general" visible={true} size="small" />
    </View>
  ) : null
}
```

## Issue 2: Ignore First '95' Progress from SSE
**Problem:** SSE sends an initial 95% progress that should be ignored to avoid confusing the user.

**Solution:** Added tracking to skip the first progress update if it's exactly 95%:

### Changes in downloadService.ts:

1. **Added new tracking Map:**
```typescript
private firstProgressReceived: Map<string, boolean> = new Map();
```

2. **Modified progress handling logic:**
```typescript
// Skip first progress if it's 95% (SSE quirk)
const isFirstProgress = !this.firstProgressReceived.get(key);
if (isFirstProgress && data.progress === 95) {
  console.log(`‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping initial 95% progress for ${key}`);
  this.firstProgressReceived.set(key, true);
  break;
}
this.firstProgressReceived.set(key, true);
```

3. **Added cleanup in cancelDownload():**
```typescript
this.firstProgressReceived.delete(downloadId);
this.lastProgressLog.delete(downloadId);
this.listenerContext.delete(downloadId);
```

4. **Added cleanup in cleanup():**
```typescript
this.firstProgressReceived.clear();
this.lastProgressLog.clear();
this.listenerContext.clear();
```

## How It Works

### First Progress Skip Logic:
1. When the first progress event arrives for a download, check if it's 95%
2. If yes, mark it as received but don't forward it to the UI
3. All subsequent progress updates are forwarded normally
4. The tracking is cleaned up when the download completes or is cancelled

### Benefits:
- Users won't see a confusing jump to 95% at the start
- Progress bar will show a smooth progression from 0% ‚Üí actual progress ‚Üí 100%
- No impact on downloads that don't start with 95%

## Files Modified
1. `src/screens/BrowseScreen.tsx` - Fixed missing key prop
2. `src/services/downloadService.ts` - Added first progress skip logic and cleanup

## Issue 3: File Already Exists Error
**Error:** `a file or directory already exist at: content://...`

**Problem:** When downloading the same file again, SAF's `createFile()` throws an error if the file already exists.

**Solution:** Check if file exists before creating it, and delete it if it does:

### Changes in downloadService.ts:

1. **Added imports:**
```typescript
import { exists, unlink } from 'react-native-saf-x';
```

2. **Added existence check in saveFromUrl():**
```typescript
const fileExists = await exists(childUri);
if (fileExists) {
  console.log(`üóëÔ∏è Deleting existing file: ${filename}`);
  await unlink(childUri);
}
```

3. **Added existence check in saveFile():**
```typescript
const fileExists = await exists(childUri);
if (fileExists) {
  console.log(`üóëÔ∏è Deleting existing file: ${filename}`);
  await unlink(childUri);
}
```

### How It Works:
1. Before creating a new file, check if it already exists at the target URI
2. If it exists, delete it first using `unlink()`
3. Then create the new file and write the content
4. This allows re-downloading the same file without errors

## Testing
- [x] Verify no key prop warnings in console
- [x] Fixed file already exists error
- [ ] Start a download and verify progress doesn't jump to 95% initially
- [ ] Verify progress bar shows smooth progression
- [ ] Verify cleanup happens on download completion
- [ ] Verify cleanup happens on download cancellation
- [ ] Download the same file twice to verify overwrite works
