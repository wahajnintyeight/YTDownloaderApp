# Silent Save Implementation - FIXED

## Summary
Implemented silent file saves to the previously selected SAF folder without prompting the user. The download service now uses the persisted tree URI with non-interactive APIs from react-native-saf-x v2.2.3.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Imports (src/services/downloadService.ts)
- Added `createFile` to the imports from `react-native-saf-x`
- This is the correct non-interactive API for creating files under a persisted tree URI

### 2. Modified `saveFromUrl()` Method
**Before:**
```typescript
const doc = await (createDocument as any)(docMime, filename); // Interactive - prompts user
```

**After:**
```typescript
const childUri = `${downloadsPath}/document/${encodeURIComponent(filename)}`;
const doc = await createFile(childUri, { mimeType: docMime });
const targetUri = doc?.uri;
await safWriteFile(targetUri, base64Data, { encoding: 'base64' });
```

### 3. Modified `saveFile()` Method
**Before:**
```typescript
const doc = await (createDocument as any)(defaultMime, filename); // Interactive - prompts user
```

**After:**
```typescript
const childUri = `${downloadsPath}/document/${encodeURIComponent(filename)}`;
const doc = await createFile(childUri, { mimeType: defaultMime });
const targetUri = doc?.uri;
await safWriteFile(targetUri, base64Data, { encoding: 'base64' });
```

### 4. Removed Noisy Logs
- Removed `console.log('ðŸ’¾ Writing file to disk...')` from `saveFromUrl()`
- Removed `console.log('ðŸ’¾ Writing base64 data to file...')` from `saveFile()`

### 5. Fixed Progress Bar Race Condition (src/hooks/useDownloads.tsx)
**Problem:** Progress updates could overwrite the completed state if they arrived after `onComplete` was called.

**Solution:** Modified the `UPDATE_PROGRESS` reducer to ignore updates for downloads that are already completed, failed, or cancelled:
```typescript
if (download.status === 'completed' || download.status === 'failed' || download.status === 'cancelled') {
  return download; // Don't update
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Persisted Permission**: The download folder location is saved in localStorage via `storageService.getDownloadPath()` and loaded into `this.customDownloadPath`

2. **Non-Interactive Creation**: Instead of using `createDocument()` which triggers a system picker dialog, we now:
   - Construct a child URI path: `${downloadsPath}/document/${encodeURIComponent(filename)}`
   - Create the file using `createFile(childUri, { mimeType })` which uses the persisted tree permission
   - Write to the returned document URI with `safWriteFile(targetUri, data, { encoding: 'base64' })`

3. **Silent Operation**: Since we're using the previously granted tree URI permission, no user interaction is required

## Progress Tracking

The progress reaches 100% on completion and stays there:
1. `COMPLETE_DOWNLOAD` reducer sets `progress: 100` and `status: 'completed'`
2. `UPDATE_PROGRESS` now ignores updates for completed downloads, preventing race conditions

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Ensure a download folder has been selected in Settings (SAF tree URI saved)
2. Start a download
3. Verify no file picker dialog appears
4. Verify file is saved silently to the selected folder
5. Verify progress reaches 100% on completion

## Notes

- This only affects SAF paths (content:// URIs)
- Regular filesystem paths continue to work as before using RNFS
- The implementation maintains backward compatibility with the existing download flow
