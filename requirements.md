# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a YouTube Video Downloader application that enables users to search for YouTube videos and download them in various formats. The application consists of a React Native mobile app (without Expo) and a Go backend service. The app features a vibrant, engaging UI with dark/light mode support, smooth animations, and an intuitive user experience. Users can search for videos using the YouTube API, view results with thumbnails and titles, select download options (format, bitrate, location), and download videos while continuing to use the app. No user authentication system is required for the initial version.
